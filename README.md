# CPA Attack
This repository make use of Correlation Power Analysis (CPA) techniques on an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) implementation coded in C, running on a STM32 ARM-based microcontroller.

The main goal will be to study the AES algorithm and the STM32 â€“ Nucleo Printed Circuit Board (PCB) and propose a measurement method. Then power traces will be captured with the
use of an Oscilloscope. The attack will be completed by performing CPA on the captured traces.
